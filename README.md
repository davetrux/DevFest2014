Code from my talk about Dependency Injection at [Michigan Google Developers DevFest 2014](http://michigandevfest.wix.com/devfest2014).

The Android projects are using Maven to manage dependencies and Robolectric to run unit tests. If you need help getting your environment set up for using Maven with Android, see [Create a new Android project with Robolectric unit test support](https://github.com/bkiers/notes/wiki/Create-a-new-Android-project-with-Robolectric-unit-test-support)
